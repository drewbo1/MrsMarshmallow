		  <p>Mrs Marshmallow is a cottage industry, which I fit in around my roles as mum, wife and after-school child-minder. I am self taught and have been building up my skill-set and client base since May 2014.</p>
		  <p>I started out around 8 years ago, buying bits and pieces from the supermarket to experiment with, then making cakes for family and friends. When my daughter was born I put away all my tools and even considered selling them! I couldn't have imagined having the time for this hobby ever again.</p>
		  <p>After the haze of keeping a new-born baby alive had passed and I felt almost human again, I came across some cake photos and absentmindedly shared them on social media. After receiving a huge amount of encouragement, a friend approached me with a commission for her husband's 30th birthday and Mrs Marshmallow was born.</p>
		  <p>Slowly and unsteadily I dipped my toe into the water - learning about the rules, regulations and legislation involved with preparing food for sale, registering my premises with Environmental Health, and setting up a Facebook page that would be how I took orders and communicated with my customers until now.</p>
		  <p>I added the helium balloon element to my services after I noticed that many of my clients were arriving for collection either with their car full of balloons, or rushing to the next business to collect some balloons for their party. I hoped it would help my customers to be able to collect both cake and balloons in one go, and lots of my customers now use this service independently or alongside their cake order.</p>
		  <p>I can't claim that it is easy, but I regularly take stock and find myself extremely grateful that I am able to work around bringing up my beautiful daughter. I'm grateful that I have a husband who supports me, and believes in me, even when I don't.  That my afternoon child-minding means my home is daily filled with the bustle and laughter of children. That my mornings and evenings are spent quietly creating beautiful things that add such joy to many special occasions!</p>
          <p>Mostly I am grateful for the group of encouraging, supportive people I encounter face-to-face or online every day. These kind words of encouragement have, and continue to build me up and allow me to believe that all this is possible. I have no doubt that without them I would never have gotten to where I am today!</p>
          <p>Please take a look around. If you are a fellow Caker, I hope you find inspiration! If you are a potential client please get in touch and Iâ€™ll try my best to cater for your needs. Thanks again for stopping by!</p>
